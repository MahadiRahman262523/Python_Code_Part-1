# Assignment Operator
# print("5+6 is ",5+6)
# print("5-6 is ",5-6)
# print("5*6 is ",5*6)
# print("5/6 is ",5/6)
# print("16//6 is ",16//6)
# print("5**6 is ",5**6)
# print("5%6 is ",5%6)


#Assignment operator
# x = 56
# print(x)
# x += 44
# print(x)


#Comparison operator
# i = 4
# print(i!=7)


#Logical operator
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)


#Identity operator
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a is b)
# print(a is not  b)


#Membership Operator
# list = [10,44,7,8,44,89,90,100]
# print(12 in list)
# print(10 in list)

# Bitwise operator
print(0 & 0)
print(0 & 1)
print(0 | 0)
print(0 | 1)
print(1 | 1)
